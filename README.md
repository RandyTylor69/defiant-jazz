<h2>Landing Page</h2>

> When you open Defiant Jazz, this is what you see: a list of your recently played pieces, as well as your current favourite. The playtime is also recorded for flexing purposes.

 <h2>Searching and Logging</h2>

> An all-purpose search engine is built for searching and logging new pieces. Much time was spent dancing around with the notorious [IMSLP API](https://imslp.org/wiki/IMSLP:API) to make it spit out what's in the search bar. The IMSLP database is in such an atrocious state that I built my own DB instead, just for this project.

<h2>Review</h2>

> Check out what others have to say about the piece you've searched for. Click the commenters' profiles to get to know them better, or upvote a review you like. Of course you can jot down your own thoughts - and edit them later into a full essay.

<h2>Community</h2>

> Once you've followed enough people, their recent reviews will start showing up in the community page. Some of the most popular pieces are also displayed on the top, chosen by the loyal users of this glorious site.
